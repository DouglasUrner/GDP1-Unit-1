### Mechanics, Dynamics, Aesthetics

### Mechanics

What is possible: the rules & resources of the game.

Note: The mechanics are all that a designer has to work with to create the ***dynamics*** and ***aesthetics*** of the game.

In board games the mechanics are completely visible – they are the rules and the game bits. In many electronic games the mechanics are invisible (or start off invisible), they are the algorithms, data sturctures, and game elements that the developers implement. Adding a computer makes it possible to "hide" the mechanics and allow the players to discover them as they see what is possible in the game.

### Dynamics

What actually happens: 

Note: The result of how the players engage with the game's mechanics (the rules & resources).

Dynamics emerge from mechanics

Note: Baseball has a mechanic - you run counter-clockwise around the bases. Hockey has no mechanic telling you how to skate backwards, but you see players doing it – that ***dynamic*** arrises because of the mechanics of the game.

### Aesthetics

The players experience of the game.
