### Mechanics, Dynamics, Aesthetics

**Warm Up:** Think about a game that you know well and start your notes for today with a list of what your ***experience*** as you play the game.

Note: Start from the players point of view with the aesthetics.

### Mechanics

What is possible: the rules & resources of the game.

Note: The mechanics are all that a designer has to work with to create the ***dynamics*** and ***aesthetics*** of the game.

In board games the mechanics are completely visible – they are the rules and the game bits. In many electronic games the mechanics are invisible (or start off invisible), they are the algorithms, data sturctures, and game elements that the developers implement. Adding a computer makes it possible to "hide" the mechanics and allow the players to discover them as they see what is possible in the game.

### Dynamics

What actually happens: 

Note: The result of how the players engage with the game's mechanics (the rules & resources).

Dynamics emerge from mechanics

Baseball has a mechanic - you run counter-clockwise around the bases. Hockey has no mechanic telling you how to skate backwards, but you see players doing it – that ***dynamic*** arrises because of the mechanics of the game.

### Aesthetics

The players experience of the game.

### The Trouble With Terms

Note:

* Mechanics: *everything* the designer has control over.
* Dynamics:
* Aesthetics: the *whole* experience of playing the game - not just the *visual* aesthetics (not the usual definition).

### Aesthetics: 8 Kinds of Fun

1. Sensation: Game as sense-pleasure
1. Fantasy: Game as make-believe
1. Narrative: Game as unfolding story
1. Challenge: Game as obstacle course	 	
1. Fellowship: Game as social framework
1. Discovery: Game as uncharted territory
1. Expression: Game as soap box
1. Submission: Game as "mindless" pastime

Note: The critical idea is not '8' but that we can distinguish different kinds of fun – there may well be a 9th or 10th or 42nd.

LeBlanc, 2004
