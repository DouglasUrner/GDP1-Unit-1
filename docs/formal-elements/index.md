Games are *systems* collections of "parts" that interact to create something that is usually "bigger than the sum of the parts." As we try to make sense of these systems it is very helpful to have some ideas about the common parts that are used to build games. These are often referred to as the *formal elements of games.*

### Formal Elements of Games

One way to analyze games in by looking at their *formal elements* and the way the game designers have combined them to produce an interactive experience for the player(s).

The articles and webpages linked below are a good way to expand your ideas about the elements of games and how they work:

### The Poster

* Name your element
* Explain your element
  - Examples - at least three from different games
* Is it always required?
* What does this element help the designer to do? For example, the theme of a game may help players to understand the actions or roles of players in a game - in a car racing game you know instinctively what the driver will do.
* Common patterns
* Make it grapically interesting

Start off your poster design in your notebooks - collect ideas for what will go on your poster and make sketches of what the poster might look like. You will be practicing the design process and you will avoid false starts - in the end you will save time.

I encourage you to create the poster digitally - your final product will be a PDF file, you could create the poster using Microsoft Word or Google Docs, or Slides or PowerPoint or Photoshop or...
