The question "what is a game?" can be surprisingly hard to answer. But it is worth the effort for several reasons:

* It helps us to clarify our purpose as we design and critique games.
* It makes it easier to communicate with other designers
* It helps us to understand the history and development of games - both electronic and physical.
* So before going on to the next part of this activity -

Start a new page in your notebook, then:

* Start by taking a few minutes to think about and then write down, in your own words, a short paragraph to answer the question "what is a game?" Tips: avoid using the word game (beyond "A game isâ€¦"); don't just describe the physical components of a game.
* Then, show your answer to a neighbor and have them "test" your answer by trying to think of examples that fit your definition, but which don't seem to be games - for example, if your definition was "a fun pastime," your neighbor might ask "is riding a bike a game?"
Make sure your notes include who checked your ideas and their questions.
* Finally, if necessary revise your definition.

Then, read Keith Burgon's article [What Makes a Game?](https://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/167418/what_makes_a_game.php) This site, Gamasutra is a website for professional game designers. Or, if you would prefer to read it on paper,  I have some paper copies. For your submission for this assignment answer the questions below in a Google Doc (or the editor of your choice) and attach them as a PDF:

* How does Keith Burgun define a *game?* See if you can explain his ideas in your own words.
* What does he say are the qualities of decisions in a "good game?" Can you give some examples from games that you play?
* What distinguishes *simulators, contests,* and *puzzles* from games? Make a chart with examples of each.
* What characteristics of some current games does he think tend to reduce the "meaning" of their in-game decisions?
* What does Keith propose that designers should be doing?
* Do you agree? Why or why not? Use examples from the games that you play.

After reading the article, have your ideas about what makes a game a game changed?

For another take on how to describe what makes a game take a look at the Understanding Games series of "playings" (as opposed to readings) at Kongregate (they try hard to get you to create an account, but you can ignore them):
