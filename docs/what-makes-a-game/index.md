The question "what is a game?" can be surprisingly hard to answer. But it is worth the effort for several reasons:

* It helps us to clarify our purpose as we design and critique games.
* It makes it easier to communicate with other designers
* It helps us to understand the history and development of games - both electronic and physical.
* So before going on to the next part of this activity -

Start a new page in your notebook, then:

* Start by taking a few minutes to think about and then write down, in your own words, a short paragraph to answer the question "what is a game?" Tips: avoid using the word game (beyond "A game isâ€¦"); don't just describe the physical components of a game.
* Then, show your answer to a neighbor and have them "test" your answer by trying to think of examples that fit your definition, but which don't seem to be games - for example, if your definition was "a fun pastime," your neighbor might ask "is riding a bike a game?"
Make sure your notes include who checked your ideas and their questions.
* Finally, if necessary revise your definition.

Then, read Keith Burgon's article [What Makes a Game?](https://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/167418/what_makes_a_game.php) This site, Gamasutra is a website for professional game designers. Or, if you would prefer to read it on paper,  I have some paper copies. For your submission for this assignment answer the questions below in a Google Doc (or the editor of your choice) and attach them as a PDF:

1. How does Keith Burgun define a *game?* See if you can explain his ideas in your own words.
1. What does he say are the qualities of decisions in a "good game?" Do the games that you play have oportunities to make "good decisions"? What are some examples?
1. What distinguishes *simulators, contests,* and *puzzles* from games? Make a table and add examples from the games that you play. Are there combinations? For example, simulators that include contests or puzzles?
1. What characteristics of some current games does Keith Burgun claim tend to reduce the "meaning" of in-game decisions?
1. What does Keith propose that designers should be doing? Give specific answers with examples. How do you think following his advice would change a game that you play?
1. How important are "meaningful decisions" in game to you? Why or why not? What is the most important element in a game to you?
1. How do you define a game?

After reading the article, how have your ideas about what makes a game a game changed?

For another take on how to describe what makes a game take a look at the Understanding Games series of "playings" (as opposed to readings) at Kongregate (they try hard to get you to create an account, but you can ignore them):
