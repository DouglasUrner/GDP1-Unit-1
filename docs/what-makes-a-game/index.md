Read the article [What Makes a Game?](https://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/167418/what_makes_a_game.php) This site, Gamasutra is a website for professional game designers. Or, if you would prefer to read it on paper,  I have some paper copies. For your submission for this assignment answer the questions below in a Google Doc (or the editor of your choice) and attach them as a PDF:

How does Keith Burgun define a game?
What does he say are the qualities of decisions in a "good game?" Can you give some examples from games that you play?
What distinguishes simulators, contests, and puzzles from games?
What characteristics of some current games does he think tend to reduce the "meaning" of their in-game decisions?
What does Keith propose that designers should be doing?
Do you agree? Why or why not? Use examples from the games that you play.

For another take on how to describe what makes a game take a look at the Understanding Games series of "playings" (as opposed to readings) at Kongregate (they try hard to get you to create an account, but you can ignore them):
