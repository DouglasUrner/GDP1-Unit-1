[Snakes and Ladders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snakes_and_Ladders) is an ancient game of chance from India. It was brought to England during the Imperial Age. It was introduced into the US in 1943 as *Chutes and Ladders* by Milton Bradley.

As designed, Snakes and Ladders is a *game of chance* – the outcome is determined entirely by the roll of the dice. This makes it an excellent family game, but it often feels boring to older players. Today we will design a set of *house rules* with the goal of making Snakes and Ladders into a game of strategy, a game where the players make decisions that affect the outcome of the game.

## House Rules For Snakes and Ladders

Imagine that you are in a remote cabin with some friends. The weather is lousy, there is no cell service, and the power is out. But there is a copy of an old game Snakes and Ladders. It appears to have been imported from England sometime in the last century. After playing it for a bit you find yourselves getting bored – the outcome of the game is entirely dependent on chance, you'd like to make it into a game of strategy.

So, using the original gameboard and *game bits,* develop new mechanics to make it into a game where the outcome is determined by the decisions that the players make.

Working in groups of 2 to 4 people:
* Make notes – start with today's date, a heading (e.g., "House Rules For Snakes and Ladders"), and the names of the people you are working with.
* Brainstorm a list of ideas for ways to add meaningful decisions, decisions that can change the outcome of the game, to the game. Keep track of the ideas that your group comes up with in your notes. Beware of changes that make the game harder or more complicated, but which don't actually create ways to change the outcome of the game.
* Pick ***one*** idea from your group's list and develop it into a mechanic that seems like it would move the game towards being a game of strategy rather than a game of chance.
* Test the mechanic that your group selected to see how it works.
* If necessary revise the mechanics.
