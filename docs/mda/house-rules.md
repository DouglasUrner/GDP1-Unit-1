[Snakes and Ladders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snakes_and_Ladders) is an ancient game of chance from India. It was introduced into the US in 1943 as *Chutes and Ladders* by Milton Bradley.

As designed, Snakes and Ladders is a *game of chance* – the outcome is determined entirely by chance (the roll of the dice). This makes it an excellent family game, but it often feels boring to older players. Today we will design a set of *house rules* with the goal of making Snakes and Ladders into a game of strategy, a game where there players make decisions that determine the outcome of the game.

## House Rules For Snakes and Ladders

Using the original gameboard, modify the rules to make Snakes and Ladders a game where the outcome is determined by the decisions they players make.

Working in groups of 2 to 4 people:
* Make notes – start with today's date, a heading (e.g., "House Rules For Snakes and Ladders"), and the names of the people you are working with.
* Brainstorm a list of ideas for ways to add meaningful decisions, decisions that can change the outcome of the game, to the game. Keep track of the ideas that your group comes up with in your notes.
* Pick ***one*** idea from your group's list that seems like it would move the game towards being a game of strategy rather than a game of chance.
* Test the mechanic that your group selected to see how it works.
