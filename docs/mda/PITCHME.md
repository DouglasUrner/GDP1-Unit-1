### Warm Up:

Review your notes - can you explain the MDA (mechanics, dynamics, aesthetics) analytical framework? Can you define explain what we mean by an *analytical framework?* Can you explain the terms *as they are used in the framework?*

Note:

### Design Principle: Aesthetics first

## Review Snakes & Ladders

* What is the *core mechanic* of the game?
* What are the aesthetics of the game?

Note:

Core mechanic of Snakes & Ladders: race to the finish
Aesthetics == the players experience

## Mechanics of Snakes & Ladders

How did the designer implement the aesthetics?

## Modification Plan

* "House rules" to make strategy a component of the game.

## In Your Notes

* Get started â€“ today's date, a heading (e.g., "House Rules For Snakes and Ladders"), and the names of the people you are working with.
* Brainstorm a list of ideas for ways to add meaningful decisions, decisions that can change the outcome of the game, to the game. Keep track of the ideas that your group comes up with in your notes.
* Pick one idea from your group's list and develop it into a mechanic that seems like it would move the game towards being a game of strategy rather than a game of chance.
* Test the mechanic that your group selected to see how it works. What works? What doesn't?
