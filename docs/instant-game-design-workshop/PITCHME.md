### The (almost) Instant Game Design Workshop

* New page in your notebook
* Boardgame for 2 (or more) players
* Race to the Finish

Note:

Quickly create a game prototype in four steps

About 5 minutes in, take stock of progress - offer ideas (what step are you on?)

### Step 1: Understand the pattern

Note: if you are stuck, draw a line.

### Step 2: Find a narrative

Note: if you are stuck, punt... Either you will find a narative

### Step 3: How do you race?

Note: if your are stuck, use a die or two

### Step 4: Add conflict

Note: if you are stuck, look for natural conflict in the play test

### Playtest

* Work with a partner (or two if we're an odd number)
* Divide up the time so everybody's game gets tested
* Testing is different than playing

Note: Refer back to ideas on the board - what do designers do?

---

### Clean Up & Collect Your Thoughts

Return materials & pick up a sticky note.

Make notes:
* What did you learn in the playtest.
* Changes and additions to rules.
* Conflicts that could make the game more interesting.
* Mark your game design with a sticky note at the top of the page

Note:

Dynamics? Aesthetics?
